### How to build and view the project:

Run these commands in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

```
npx expo start
```

- To be able to view the app, you need to have the **Expo Go app** downloaded on your phone. Then you can scan the QR code that will appear in the terminal after you have run the commands above.
